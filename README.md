# OUR STORY

Our Story aka. Ourstory project is a **multi-lingual, flexible and expandable** archive of collections of stories. Visitors can search this archive for stories. The archive does not only support simple text search, but rahter semantic search.

## Story

A story is a material collected by researchers and mostly told by someone. A story could be oral history, folklore songs, fairy tale ..etc

Stories could be backed with video, audio or image media such as a film recording the story teller while telling the story.

## Collection

Stories are collected in a context of projects carried out by organizations interested in heritage and oral history of people.

All stories collected in a context of a project are organized in collection. Hakawati Collection is an example of such project in which more than 400 stories were collected.

# Features

The archive has the following main features:

- **Expandable:** Collections and stories could be added dynamically.
- **Flexible:** Collection-specific fields can be defined dynamically, so these fields appear only in stories which belong to this collection.
- **Multi-lingual:** A new language could be added with a minimum technical efforts.
- **Semantically Searchable:** Archive supports semantic search according to each language's characterstics such as plural recognition in Arabic.
- **Role-based Functionalities:** Users can perform actions based on their role in the system and their role in each collection.

# System Parts

The system consists of three **_separate_** parts (sub-projects)

## Backend
